Hello, very glad to welcome you to my blog. My name is Nguyen Nhat Minh Khoi and I'd love if you calling me by Rainbow Dango (isn't it funny?). My aim job is data scientist and I'm trying my best to learn about that.  

In this page, I will write about movies, books, programming, mathematics and anything that I could. Some of the blog is in English, some is in Vietnamese, hope that you have no problem with this.

In case you'd like to contact with me, there is my info at the end of the page. 

That's all, enjoy your adventure through my blog! ^^
